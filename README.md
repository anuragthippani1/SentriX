# SentriX - Multi-Agent Supply Chain Risk Intelligence Platform

SentriX is a proof-of-concept Agentic AI application for real-time supply chain risk intelligence, built using only free agents and APIs. It helps expeditors monitor and assess supply chain risks across multiple domains in near real time.

## 🌍 Core Features

- **Real-time Risk Monitoring**: Track political, schedule, and logistics risks
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: 4 specialized AI agents working together
- **Interactive Dashboard**: World map visualization with risk heatmaps
- **Natural Language Queries**: Chat with AI assistant for risk analysis
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate and download detailed risk assessments
- **Free APIs**: Uses only free-tier services (no credit card required)

## 🤖 Multi-Agent System

### 1. Assistant Agent
- Handles greetings, help, and general queries
- Uses OpenAI GPT for natural language processing
- Routes queries to appropriate specialized agents

### 2. Scheduler Agent
- Analyzes equipment schedule data
- Identifies delivery delays and risk levels (1-5)
- Returns structured JSON with schedule risks

### 3. Political Risk Agent
- Uses NewsData.io and GNews (free APIs) for news analysis
- Analyzes political/geopolitical events by country
- Assigns likelihood scores based on recentness and severity
- Provides citations and source links

### 4. Reporting Agent
- Combines outputs from other agents
- Generates comprehensive risk reports
- Creates downloadable PDF/DOCX reports
- Formats data for visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Community Edition or Atlas Free Tier)
- **Charts & Maps**: react-simple-maps, recharts
- **News APIs**: NewsData.io, GNews (free tiers)
- **LLM**: OpenAI free tier
- **Reporting**: python-docx, reportlab

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas free tier)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SentriX
npm run install-all
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cd backend
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (optional for demo)
```

3. **Start the application:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000).

### API Keys (Optional)

The application works with sample data by default. For live data, add these to `backend/.env`:

```env
# OpenAI API Key (for enhanced responses)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# News API Keys (for live political risk data)
NEWSDATA_API_KEY=your-newsdata-key
GNEWS_API_KEY=your-gnews-key

# MongoDB (optional, uses file fallback)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sentrix
```

## 📱 Usage

### Dashboard
- View global risk heatmap
- See real-time political and schedule risks
- Interact with chat assistant
- Monitor risk trends with charts

### Chat Assistant
Ask natural language questions like:
- "What are the political risks?"
- "Which equipment has delivery delays?"
- "Show me the risk summary"
- "Generate a comprehensive report"

### Reports
- View all generated reports
- Filter by type and search
- Download PDF reports
- Track report history

### Thinking Logs
- Monitor AI agent reasoning
- View conversation history
- Track decision-making process

## 🔧 Development

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Database Setup
The application uses MongoDB but falls back to file storage if unavailable. For production:

1. Install MongoDB locally or use MongoDB Atlas free tier
2. Update `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`
3. The app will automatically create necessary indexes

## 📊 Sample Data

The application includes sample data for demonstration:
- Equipment schedules with various delay scenarios
- Political risk events for major countries
- Risk assessments and recommendations

## 🎯 Key Features

### Risk Assessment
- **Political Risks**: Trade policies, sanctions, labor disputes
- **Schedule Risks**: Delivery delays, timeline impacts
- **Combined Analysis**: Integrated risk scoring

### Visualization
- **World Map**: Color-coded risk levels by country
- **Charts**: Risk distribution and trend analysis
- **Tables**: Detailed risk breakdowns with citations

### Reporting
- **PDF Generation**: Professional risk reports
- **Multiple Formats**: Political, schedule, and combined reports
- **Downloadable**: Easy sharing and archiving

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- All API calls use HTTPS
- No sensitive data stored permanently
- Session-based data management
- Free-tier APIs only (no credit card required)
