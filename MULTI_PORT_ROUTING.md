# Multi-Port Route Planning Feature

## Overview
The Multi-Port Route Planning feature enables users to plan and optimize shipping routes across multiple ports worldwide, moving beyond simple point-to-point routing to support complex multi-stop itineraries.

## Key Features

### 📍 **50+ Global Ports**
- Major ports across all continents (Asia Pacific, Europe, Americas, Africa, Middle East, Oceania)
- Port information includes:
  - Geographical coordinates
  - Country and region
  - Port capacity level
  - Average wait times

### 🚢 **Multi-Leg Route Planning**
- Plan routes with 2 to unlimited ports
- Automatic calculation for each leg:
  - Distance (nautical miles and kilometers)
  - Transit time (accounting for ship speed)
  - Port wait times
  - Fuel costs
  - Port fees
  - Canal tolls (Suez, Panama)
- Risk assessment for each route segment

### ⚡ **Route Optimization**
Four optimization strategies available:
1. **Fastest** - Minimize total travel time
2. **Cheapest** - Minimize total cost
3. **Balanced** - Balance between time and cost
4. **Safest** - Prioritize low-risk routes

### 🗺️ **Canal Detection & Costs**
- Automatic detection of major shipping canals:
  - **Suez Canal** (Mediterranean ↔ Red Sea)
    - Average toll: $400,000
    - Transit time: 0.5 days
  - **Panama Canal** (Atlantic ↔ Pacific)
    - Average toll: $450,000
    - Transit time: 0.4 days

### 💰 **Comprehensive Cost Analysis**
- Fuel costs: $2.50 per nautical mile
- Port fees: ~$27,000 per port pair
- Canal tolls (when applicable)
- Total route cost summary

### 📊 **Detailed Route Analysis**
For each route, users receive:
- Total distance, time, and cost
- Number of ports and legs
- Leg-by-leg breakdown
- Risk level indicators
- Canal usage information
- Estimated departure and arrival times

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Libraries**:
  - `math` for Haversine distance calculations
  - `pydantic` for data validation
  - `datetime` for time calculations

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Asia-Europe Trade Route
```
Singapore → Dubai → Rotterdam
- Distance: 5,949 nm
- Time: 18.9 days
- Cost: $468,873
- Uses: Suez Canal
```

### 2. Trans-Pacific Route
```
Shanghai → Los Angeles → Panama → New York
- Includes Panama Canal transit
- Optimized for fastest delivery
```

### 3. Round-the-World Cargo
```
Rotterdam → Suez → Singapore → Sydney → Panama → New York → Rotterdam
- Multi-continent routing
- Both major canals
- Complex optimization

```

## Calculations & Algorithms

### Distance Calculation
Uses the **Haversine formula** for great-circle distance:
```
a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × sin²(Δlon/2)
c = 2 × arcsin(√a)
distance = Earth's radius × c
```

### Time Calculation
```
Transit Time = Distance / Ship Speed (20 knots)
Total Time = Transit Time + Port Wait Times + Canal Transit Times
```

### Cost Calculation
```
Fuel Cost = Distance × $2.50/nm
Port Fees = $15,000 departure + $12,000 arrival
Canal Tolls = Based on canal used
Total Cost = Fuel + Port Fees + Canal Tolls
```

### Risk Assessment
Simplified risk model based on:
- Country political stability
- Route length
- Historical incident data
- Regional security levels

### Route Optimization
Uses **greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm**:
1. Start at origin
2. Find nearest unvisited port
3. Move to that port
4. Repeat until all waypoints visited
5. End at destination

## Future Enhancements

1. **WorldMap Visualization**
   - Draw multi-leg routes on interactive map
   - Animate ship movement
   - Show real-time weather overlays

2. **Advanced Optimization**
   - Genetic algorithms for optimal ordering
   - Multi-objective optimization
   - Time window constraints

3. **Real-Time Data Integration**
   - Live port congestion data
   - Dynamic fuel prices
   - Weather routing

4. **Alternative Routes**
   - Multiple route suggestions
   - Pros/cons comparison
   - What-if scenarios

5. **Vessel-Specific Planning**
   - Different ship types and speeds
   - Cargo-specific routing
   - Draft and size restrictions

## Database Structure

### Ports Table
```python
{
  "name": "Singapore",
  "country": "Singapore",
  "region": "Asia Pacific",
  "coordinates": {"lat": 1.2897, "lon": 103.8501},
  "capacity": "very_high",
  "avg_wait_time": 1.5  # days
}
```

### Route Report Schema
```python
RiskReport(
  report_id: str,
  session_id: str,
  report_type: "multi_port_route",
  created_at: datetime,
  title: str,
  executive_summary: str,
  recommendations: List[str],
  route_analysis: str  # JSON-encoded full route data
)
```

## Performance Notes

- **Port List Loading**: < 100ms
- **Route Calculation**: < 500ms for 10 ports
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (lightweight calculations)
- **Scalability**: Can handle 50+ port routes

## Testing
